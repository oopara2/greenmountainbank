# Green Mountain Bank Application

This Bank Application was created using the MERN stack. It ustilizes Boostrap for the CSS components. This application allows the user to create an account, login, deposit, withdrawal, and check balance of account. 

## Installation

Use the package manager node to install dependencies. 

```bash
Go to ui-client folder and server folder and run npm install. 
```

## To start application

```javascript
Go to ui-client folder and type in terminal  npm start
Go to backend "server" folder and run node index.js

Please note that you must have a MongoDB database running. You can update the sever details in db.config.js.ddd You can also use a Docker container if you do not have MongoDB installed.

```
